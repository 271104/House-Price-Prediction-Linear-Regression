# House Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the application of simple linear regression to predict house prices based on a single feature from the House_Prices_Dataset.

## Objective

- Analyze and visualize housing data.
- Understand the relationship between the house feature (e.g., area) and price.
- Build and evaluate a simple linear regression model.
- Use the model to predict house prices.

## Dataset

**File Name:** House_Prices_Dataset.csv

The dataset includes information about house features and their corresponding prices. For this project, only one independent variable (such as area or number of rooms) is used to predict the house price.

## Concepts Covered

- Simple Linear Regression
- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Model Evaluation using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Workflow Summary

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Visualize the relationship between the selected feature and house price.
3. Train a simple linear regression model.
4. Predict house prices based on the feature.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
6. Interpret the results and draw conclusions.

## Conclusion

Simple linear regression is an effective starting point for understanding supervised learning problems. This project provides foundational knowledge on how to model and predict continuous variables like house prices using one feature.
